# About

This is a quick and dirty converter from [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) filters to [imapfilter](https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter) config.
It is nowhere near complete and only implements the few filters and actions I needed.
Yet, it should be fairly easy to add missing filters and actions (as long as they are supported by imapfilter).
It may also break with future versions of Thunderbird as I did not find any official specification for the parsed file.

Use at your own risk.

# Migrated
